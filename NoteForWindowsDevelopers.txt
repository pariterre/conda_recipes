On Windows, the default compiler (provided by cxx) is VS2015.
If you want to use another one, you have to use the command prompt provided by the desired VS. 
Then, if you want to use conda, you should run the script "activate.bat" that can be found in "Scripts" folder of the installed miniconda
To activate an environment, use the "activate" script that can be found at the same place.
